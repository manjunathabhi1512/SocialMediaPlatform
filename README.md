Social Media Platform: 

    The demo of the social media platform demonstrate the functionality of 
        - post content (text content only)
        - comments on each posts
        - like and dislike on each posts
        - share the post via link
        
    And the solution is formed without any use of database, just by utilising the power of Go Hashmaps and structures the datas are stored in In-Memory key value store.
